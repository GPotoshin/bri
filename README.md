What if we train an LLM to translate proofs from human language to Coq in order to formalize them?
This way, we can add another layer of rigor to verify the reasoning of LLMs or have a powerful tool to verify proofs.

If you want, you can join me on this journey or take your own path toward a brighter future!

However, to train an LLM, we will need some data.

## Acheivements
We have the embending layer and tokenizer. As the example the text
```
The infinite is the answer to all questions. All questions have one answer. And therefore there are not many questions, but only one question. This question is: what is the infinite?
```
is tokenized into
```
 the| in|fini|t|e| is| the| answer| to| all| quest|ion|s|.| all| quest|ion|s| have| on|e| answer|.| and| there|for|e| there| are| not| many| quest|ion|s|,| but| only| on|e| quest|ion|.| this| quest|ion| is|:| what| is| the| in|fini|t|e|?|
```

## Problems
+ we need to agree on a common style of proofs
+ we need a table of proofs in English -> in Coq
