What if we train an LLM to translate proofs from human language to Coq in order to formalize them?
This way, we can add another layer of rigor to verify the reasoning of LLMs or have a powerful tool to verify proofs.

If you want, you can join me on this journey or take your own path toward a brighter future!

However, to train an LLM, we will need some data.

## Problems
+ we need to agree on a common style of proofs
+ we need a table of proofs in English -> in Coq
+ we need to decide which model and how to use (an open source one, of course)
